# Breast-Cancer---EDA-PCA-Hyperparameter-tuning
## Introduction
Breast cancer is one of the most commonly occuring cancers worldwide and according to global statistics, it reperesents a very high percentage of cancer-related deaths
In this repository, our goal is to build a machine learning model that can differentiate benign breast cancer lumps from the malignant ones
<br />
We will use several ML algorithms and evaluate their performance and predictive power after applying PCA and hyperparameter tuning techniques in order to come up with a 'best fit' model trained on data collected 
<br />
## About the Dataset
Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set 
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. n the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
This database is also available through the UW CS ftp server: ftp ftp.cs.wisc.edu cd math-prog/cpo-dataset/machine-learn/WDBC/
